            <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container
                with a lid.
                Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess.
                Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and
                juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare.
                Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste,
                garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat;
                bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add
                ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes.
                Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>

        </ol>
